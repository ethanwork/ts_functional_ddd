## Debugging
You can debug the application by going to the debug menu and select the dropdown next to the green arrow and select Node.js, then select 'Run Script: dev'.

You can debug the tests by doing the same thing, except select 'Run Script: servertest'.

## Debugging Extensions
The 'Jest Runner' by 'firsttris' extension also appears to work with setting breakpoints within a test and if you click 'Debug' above the test code it will run just that specific test and hit the breakpoint.
